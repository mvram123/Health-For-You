# Health For You


![alt text](https://github.com/mvram123/health-for-u/blob/main/readme_resources/main.png)

- This repository consists of files required to deploy a Machine Learning Web App created with Flask on Heroku platform.
- Here, I have developed a disease predicting web app which uses Machine Learning for making predictions about various diseases like Cancer, Diabetes, Liver Failure etc
- Here is the link where you can access the project live :- https://health-for-you.herokuapp.com/
- The entire code is developed in modular fashion.
- Machine Learning Algorithms used here :- Random Forest, Catboost

## Features

In this project, I present a website in which the following applications are implemented:

- Cancer Prediction :-  predict whether the tumour type is Malignant or Benign.
- Diabetes Prediction :- predict whether someone is diabetic or not
- Heart Failure Prediction :- predict if someone is at high risk of heart failure or not.
- Kidney Failure Prediction :- predict whether somebody is at high risk for kidney failure or not.
- Liver Failure Prediction :- predict whether somebody is at high risk for liver failure or not.

## Algorithms Used

- cancer.csv :- Random Forest
- diabetes.csv :- Random Forest
- heart.csv :- Random Forest
- kidney.csv :- Cat Boost
- liver.csv :- Random Forest
