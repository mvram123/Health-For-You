# Health For You


![alt text](https://github.com/mvram123/health-for-u/blob/main/readme_resources/main.png)

This repository consists of files required to deploy a Machine Learning Web App created with Flask on Heroku platform.

Here, I have developed a disease predicting web app which uses Machine Learning for making predictions about various diseases like Cancer, Diabetes, Liver Failure etc.

Here is the link where you can access the project live :- [Health For You](https://health-for-you.herokuapp.com).

The entire code is developed in modular fashion.

Machine Learning Algorithms used here :- **Random Forest, Catboost**

## Features

In this project, I present a website in which the following applications are implemented:

1. **Cancer Prediction** :-  predict whether the tumour type is Malignant or Benign.
2. **Diabetes Prediction** :- predict whether someone is diabetic or not.
3. **Heart Failure Prediction** :- predict if someone is at high risk of heart failure or not.
4. **Kidney Failure Prediction** :- predict whether somebody is at high risk for kidney failure or not.
5. **Liver Failure Prediction** :- predict whether somebody is at high risk for liver failure or not.


## Algorithms Used

Algorithms are selected automatically based on the accuracy

- **cancer.csv** :- Random Forest
- **diabetes.csv** :- Random Forest
- **heart.csv** :- Random Forest
- **kidney.csv** :- Cat Boost
- **liver.csv** :- Random Forest

## Further Developments

- Frontend can be made more nicer
- More data can be collected from different resources.
- Feature engineering part need to be devolped.
- Neural networks and other machine learning algorithms can be used to figure out the best model. 
- logging
